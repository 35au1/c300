            <h2 class="modal-title">Patch 4E9 Announcement</h2>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>Patch 4E9 was the result of gold tripling caused by a duplication exploit. We are talking about at least 60 million gold dropped directly onto the ground.</p>
                
                <p>c300 had been reporting gold-related issues since December, without any response, receiving only information from the admins that there are many income sources and that such behavior was "normal."</p>
                
                <p>There are currently at least five parallel theories, with no official confirmation as to what the actual source of the exploit was. The closest and most discussed theory points to potion crafting. There has also been significant discussion around daily server restarts, misconfiguration, or sabotage. Or sabotage. <strong>SABOTAGE.</strong> Map, quest, or other engine-related modifications made by mods are being discussed, and strange items appearing on EO players further fuel speculation.</p>
                
                <p>Because there are many contradictory theories and the confirmations coming from V are strange and inconsistent, one must also assume that the exploit remains unfixed. I repeat: <strong>UNFIXED.</strong></p>
                
                <p>On the other hand, there has been talk of sales misconfiguration across various mobs, so it is also possible that this was simply an oversight.</p>
                
                <p>Item duplication will happen again in the future — 100%. This is not speculation.</p>
                
                <p>For the good of the game, V claims to have implemented a monitoring system. As a result, things will now be harder, certain activities will be carried out on a smaller scale, and with greater caution.</p>
                
                <p>In practice, what we witnessed was a <strong>PARTIAL WIPE.</strong> Many players lost gold and items.</p>
                
                <p>Gold limits should also apply to EXP. A level cap of 150 is absurd and only promotes bot competition.</p>
                
                <p>Huge thanks to Danny for fighting to the very end to get Vult's attention, who identified the issue through careful observation.</p>
                
                <p>This situation will undoubtedly strengthen c300.</p>
                
                <p class="modal-closing">As they say — now it's our turn.</p>
